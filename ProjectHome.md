The project aims to provide the user with the knowledge needed to ensure that there is always some money left in his pockets. This means defining several recurring transactions including one's income and then working with pay (or income) periods. Upon creation of a period, it will be filled with the recurring transactions, effectively telling you whether or not the period's income will be sufficient and if so, how much money you will be allowed to spend while paying off all expenses during the period.
